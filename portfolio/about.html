             <h1 >ABOUT ME</h1>
             <p>Hi! My name is Laiza Senerado, I'm 19 years old, from Caloocan City. I'm thrilled to introduce myself as an aspiring educator. I'm pursuing a Bachelor of Secondary education major in English at New era University . Today, I want to share with you why I'm so passionate about becoming a teacher and how my experiences have prepared me for this rewarding journey."

As a future educator, I believe in fostering critical thinking, creating a supportive community. I am dedicated to tailoring my teaching methods to meet the diverse needs of students, ensuring that each individual can thrive academically and personally in my classroom. What fuels my enthusiasm for education is the belief that every student has the potential to excel when provided with the right guidance and support. I see education not just as a transfer of knowledge but as a transformative experience for both students and educators.

In addition to my academic studies, I've developed strong communication, organization, and adaptability skills. These skills, combined with my passion for teaching, make me confident in my ability to create a positive and impactful educational experience for my students.</p>
